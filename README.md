# CookBook-WPF

The purpose of this project is to simulate a cooking book in the form of an application.

The target audience for this application is for those who would like to add recipes and view them without the need of using physical paper. In order to complete develop this application, I used WPF.

This application has various features that would aid with productivity for the user(s). The user would be able to search for all the stored recipes with filters such as categories and by a substring of a name of the recipe. There are also other basic CRUD features such as editing and deleting recipes.
